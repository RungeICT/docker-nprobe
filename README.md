Centos:7 image for ntop's nprobe

## Introduction
In commercial environments, NetFlow is probably the de-facto standard for network traffic accounting. nProbe includes both a NetFlow v5/v9/IPFIX probe and collector that can be used to play with NetFlow flows. This means nProbe™ can be used:

 - To collect and export NetFlow flows generated by border gateways/switches/routers or any other device that can export in NetFlow v5/v9
 - As a drop-in replacement of embedded, low-speed, NetFlow probes that may already been deployed
 - To analyze multi-Gbit networks at full speed with no (or very moderate) packet loss
 - To send monitored flows towards a collector such as the open-source ntopng or a commercial one (e.g. Cisco NetFlow Collector or Plixer)
 
Currently nProbe™ is a software application available stand-alone or as an embedded system named nBox .
